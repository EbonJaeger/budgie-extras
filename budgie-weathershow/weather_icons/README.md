## About the iconset
This iconset is the newly drawn set, to replace the first set that came with weathershow in 2017. The icons' geometry and proportions are optimized for weathershow.

Inspiration was from the iconset by Bas Milius (http://bas.dev), in the repository: https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons.
