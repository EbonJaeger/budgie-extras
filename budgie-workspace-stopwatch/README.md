# Budgie Workspace Timer Applet

Workspace Timer Applet is an applet to keep track of usage per workspace, e.g. to find out how much minutes/hours were actually spent on a job.
Workspaces can be freely named, custom names and all data are rmembered, also after logout/restart, until the RESET button is pressed.
The log file is updated on workspace switch/clicking the icon for popup or else every 30 seconds.
Time during suspend is automatically retracted from a workspace' time.
