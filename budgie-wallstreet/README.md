# Budgie WallStreet

Budgie WallStreet is a mini-app to switch wallpapers on regular intervals. Options include:

- set a custom folder with wallpapers to rotate
- set time interval in hours/minutes/seconds
- use random order
- synchronize lock-screen wallpaper

By default, the default set of wallpapers is rotated.

This application has been created primarily for the budgie-desktop but will also work on gnome-shell.
