 - Countdown: This applet is now vertical panel friendly with icons and text respecting the space available on vertical panels
 - General: Latest translations from the Transifex team
 - budgie-workspace-wallpaper-applet has been rewritten in Vala.  This has been done primarily to ensure no inadvertent panel crashes.  In addition it takes into account the budgie desktop changes we made to switch wallpapers almost instantaneously (without animation) when switching workspaces.
