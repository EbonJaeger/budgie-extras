# Budgie Wallpaper Workspace Switcher 

is an application (applet) to show a different wallpaper on each of the workspaces. Usage is simple: add the applet to the panel and set wallpapers on each of the workspaces in the way you are used to. The applet will remember what wallpaper was set on each of the workspaces.
