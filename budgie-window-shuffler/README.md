## Window Shuffler
Window Shuffler is a desktop add-on for tiling, launching, managing and automation, of windows and their position(s).

Shuffler basically exists of a cluster of executabels and (sub)processes, each with their own task, around *shufflerdaemon*. These executables often borrow functionality from each other and form an organic whole.

### Features:
- Quarter/half drag-tiling with preview
- 2/5 and 3/5 width drag-tiling with preview
- Keyboard shortcuts for quarter/half drag-tiling
- Arrange (all) windows in an arbitrary grid by keyboard shordcut
- Resize windows by keyboard shordcut
- move windows by keyboard shordcut
- Open presets of windows, and arrange them into a grid, including preset workspaces (layouts)
- set windowrules for wm-classes (rules)
- Grid windows from a grid-gui
- An applet to arrange windows according to a preset layout
- Swap two windows' position and size 


## note:
GNOME 40 and later utilises the Shuffler super alt left/right keys. For Ubuntu Budgie we use a gsetting override to revert to wm keybindings prior to GNOME 40
