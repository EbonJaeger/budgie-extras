Version 1.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2022-03-11

Notes:
 * Budgie Bonanza

Features:
 * Budgie Applications Menu applet: this has the following enhancements from upstream:
    - App context menu available when right click from search results.
    Reads the PrefersNonDefaultGPU setting from .desktop files and uses that to automatically configure default or non-default GPU.
    - Adds a new context menu to support choosing the other GPU (integrated if PrefersNonDefaultGPU is set to true, discrete if key not present or its set to false).
    - Categories have been slimmed down - less apps should default to the “Other” category.
    when searching, Nemo bookmarks are also displayed in the search results.
* Applications menu category view now defaults to 6px which gives a less squashed look for most themes - this can be configured via the applet settings.
* Quicknote pop-up correctly retains its scroll-position so no need to keep scrolling up and down to find text you previously was looking at.
* Made Shuffler more robust, handling situations when a window was just closed before a shuffler action was performed on it,  or when trying to perform an action on a window of an invalid window type (e.g. a dialog window).
* Stylish new Shuffler panel icon
* Budgie Previews, Budgie Quickchar and Budgie Window Shuffler now appear in GNOME-Software with meaningful descriptions and pictures.
* Shuffle windows according to which is the active monitor.
* Shuffle Control window animations match Budgie Settings' cross-fade.
* Fix Shuffler rules to check window type (so e.g. dialog windows won't be positioned).
* Dropby handle MMC (SD Cards) as well as USB.
* Add ChromeOS based layout.
* Update default Ubuntu Budgie layout.
* Add delay option for Hot-corners; useful for touchpads that have difficulty measuring speed of movement.
* Lots and lots of translations.
* Handle terminating secondary processes more gracefully, when applets are removed from the panel .
* Removed Window Mover applet since no longer supported.
* Removed Workspace Overview applet since no longer supported.
* Ejecting from Dropby is managed with modern API.
* Fixed Dropby popup timing.
* Replaced deprecated Notify2 based notifications with notify-send.
* Desktop file icons moved to the recommended hicolor icon folder location.
* Fixed missing QuickChar icon; new icon designed.
* Network applet settings now opens in budgie-control-center if installed.

Version 1.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2021-09-15

Notes:
 * Hustle and Shuffle

Features:
 * Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators
 * Fix for spamming the syslog when previews was enabled but end-user was logged into a wayland desktop session
 * Budgie Window Shuffler applet to apply layouts visually
   Fix for Window Shuffler layouts executable installation path to work on stateless distros
   Window Shuffler Control has been completely revamped and redesigned
   Shuffler now includes Window Rules
   Shuffler Window rules now allow you to open application windows on specific workspaces
   - note: GNOME 40 and later utilises the Shuffler super alt left/right keys. For Ubuntu Budgie we use a gsetting override to revert to wm keybindings prior to GNOME 40
 * Applications Menu - Calculator now shows a visual hint how to copy the result to the clipboard. Try it - press Super then enter 2+2
   Applications Menu - transition from Grid to List modes is now a fade rather than a slide animation
   We no longer install the elementary gsettings schema - this ensures we don’t clash with a pantheon install. The elementary schema entry is now found in the budgie applications schema.
   Some themes space the category list oddly. We now have a user configurable override (adjust category spacing) in the applet settings allowing you to control the spacing.
 * Fuzzy Clock - always default to 12hr spoken clock format
 * Network applet: Fix where after connecting to a VPN spinner cursor was still showing
 * VisualSpace - we now display a hint when you open the popover - scrolling over the panel icon changes the workspace.
 * Brightness Controller has now been reworked to use GNOMEs dbus control … so this should be all distro friendly and will reflect accurately the same Power slider in GNOME Settings.

Notes:
 * Run Rabbit Run

Features:
 * Hotcorners: Option added to configure hotcorners via budgie-desktop-settings and therefore hide the icon from the panel
 * Dropby: Applet settings now has the ability to display the USB window notification in any corner you define
 * Dropby: Animation when copying media so that you now when copying is in progress/finished
 * Application Menu: Touch Screen friendly - can now swipe on your touchscreen
 * Application Menu: Better keyboard navigation from the search to categories etc.
 * Application Menu: Search bar changes position to the bottom when on a bottom panel
 * Application Menu: Hide the large number of Settings menu icons shown in the grid view and the System Tools category menu - its more elegant this way - use the search capabilities to find Settings options like bluetooth and sharing etc.
 * Application Menu: In a similar fashion the logout/restart/suspend/shutdown icons have now been removed.  Search actions are now available for these + the ability to "lock" the screen when searching and "hibernate" if you have enabled hibernation separately
 * Application Menu: Mouse rollover capability in the category view is now available via applet settings
 * Application Menu: Handle fractions calculations correctly
 * Previews: auto close when app loses focus
 * Previews: enable/disabling the capability is now dynamic - there is no need to logout/login
 * Previews: Multiple Libreoffice windows are previewed correctly to allow switching
 * Previews: now displays a tooltip on mouse hover (configurable) to show the full window name

 * Window Shuffler Sticky Neighbours - new capability to resize adjacent windows automatically
 * Window Shuffler - feedback when trying to tile windows that have a minimum size bigger than the tile placement
 * Window Shuffler - add CLI option to place apps to any tile position. This allows everyone to script their launch and placement setup
 * WeatherShow - add the ability to display a custom location for the weather city
 * Make distro friendly: Some distros don't use some stuff located in /usr/bin and other file locations.  We have now reworked the vala applets/mini apps to compile to user-defined system locations (i.e. via meson --bindir --sysconfdir --prefix --libdir)
 * Countdown: This applet is now vertical panel friendly with icons and text respecting the space available on vertical panels
 * General: Latest translations from the Transifex team
 * budgie-workspace-wallpaper-applet has been rewritten in Vala.  This has been done primarily to ensure no inadvertent panel crashes.  In addition it takes into account the budgie desktop changes we made to switch wallpapers almost instantaneously (without animation) when switching workspaces.
 * Keyboard Autoswitcher: Stop crash when gnome-screensaver starts before the panel starts
